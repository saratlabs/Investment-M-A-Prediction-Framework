# Investment & Acquisition Prediction using Financial Metrics

This project aims to predict **potential acquisition interest** in companies using financial indicators through a combination of **Equity Valuation Metrics**, **Supervised ML (Logistic Regression)**, and **Unsupervised ML (KMeans Clustering)**. It uses a structured pipeline from raw data ingestion to model output with clean preprocessing, visualization, and export-ready components.

## Theoretical Background

### 1. Equity Valuation Metrics
These are fundamental metrics that help investors determine whether a company is undervalued or overvalued:
- **P/E Ratio (Price-to-Earnings):** Indicates how much investors are willing to pay per unit of earnings.
- **P/B Ratio (Price-to-Book):** Assesses market price relative to book value.
- **PEG Ratio (Price/Earnings to Growth):** Adjusts P/E by the expected earnings growth rate.
- **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** Measures financial leverage.
- **ROE (Return on Equity):** Shows how effectively equity is converted into profit.
- **Free Cash Flow:** Represents the cash a company generates after capital expenditures.

### 2. Logistic Regression (Supervised Learning)
Used here to classify whether a company is likely to be acquisition-worthy based on its financial metrics. It outputs probabilities and class labels (0 = not target, 1 = acquisition target).

### 3. KMeans Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)
Helps visualize companies into distinct clusters based on their financial similarity. No label is required for clustering. This enhances interpretability for investment decision-making.
